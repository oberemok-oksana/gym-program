## TIPS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Ensure that the lower back doesn’t arch as you extend the hip, you should focus on squeezing the glutes and slightly posteriorly tilting the pelvis.
- Don’t allow the hips to drop or rotate as you bridge the hips up.
- Focus on exhaling as you bridge the hips up. You shouldn’t feel the movement through your lower back at all.
- If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.
