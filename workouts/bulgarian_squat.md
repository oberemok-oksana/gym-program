## WARM UP:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- 5-10 minutes of light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.);

  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;

## INSTRUCTIONS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

1. Set up in a split stance position while grasping dumbbells by your side with a neutral grip.
2. Position the back foot on a bench or circular pad to increase the range of motion.
3. Descend by flexing the front knee and continue until the back knee touches the ground directly beneath the hip.
4. Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for 3/4 sets of 10 reps.

## TIPS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- You can utilize a bench for this variation but it may be slightly more uncomfortable on the ankle joint. As such, it may be wiser to use the pad on the leg extension machine or perhaps the squat pad attached to a bar at a lower height. Ideally the back foot should be positioned at knee height or slightly below. Setting the back foot too high will likely just drive your lumbar spine into excessive extension.
- If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.
- If you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.
- You donâ€™t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral.
