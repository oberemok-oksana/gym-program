## WARM UP:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Arm circles: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms out to the sides. Make small circles with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Wrist rotations: Hold your arms straight out in front of you with your palms facing down. Slowly rotate your wrists in a circular motion, making sure to move only your wrists and not your arms. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Light weight curls: Grab a pair of light weights (or a weight bar) and do a few sets of 10-15 curls. This will help to warm up your biceps and forearms.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

1. Set up by grasping a set of dumbbells and standing straight up with the dumbbells by your sides.
2. You should be using a neutral grip, meaning your palms are facing your body.
3. Bend your arms slightly to take tension into the biceps.
4. Keeping your body fixed and elbows in at your sides, slowly curl the dumbbells up as far as possible.
5. Squeeze the biceps at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for 3/4 sets of 10 reps.

## TIPS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Do not lean back as you move the weight - this is cheating!
- Keep your elbows locked in by your sides throughout the set. Don't allow them to come forward as you curl the weight up. Focus on only allowing your forearms to move.
- Squeeze and hold at the top of the movement for maximum results.
- Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight for the whole set.
