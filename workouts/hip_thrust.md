## WARM UP:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Arm circles: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms out to the sides. Make small circles with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Wrist rotations: Hold your arms straight out in front of you with your palms facing down. Slowly rotate your wrists in a circular motion, making sure to move only your wrists and not your arms. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Light weight curls: Grab a pair of light weights (or a weight bar) and do a few sets of 10-15 curls. This will help to warm up your biceps and forearms.

## TIPS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Ensure that the lower back doesn’t arch as you extend the hip, you should focus on squeezing the glutes and slightly posteriorly tilting the pelvis.
- Don’t allow the hips to drop or rotate as you bridge the hips up.
- Focus on exhaling as you bridge the hips up. You shouldn’t feel the movement through your lower back at all.
- If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.
