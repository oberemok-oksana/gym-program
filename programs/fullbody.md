description: `A full body workout is a type of exercise routine that targets all major muscle groups in the body, including the chest, back, arms, shoulders, legs, and core. It typically involves a combination of strength training exercises, such as weightlifting, and cardiovascular exercises, such as running or cycling. A full body workout is ideal for individuals who are looking to build muscle, increase strength, and improve overall fitness and endurance. It can be done at home or in a gym with equipment or bodyweight exercises, and can be adapted to suit different fitness levels and goals."
