## WARM UP:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Arm circles: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms out to the sides. Make small circles with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Wrist rotations: Hold your arms straight out in front of you with your palms facing down. Slowly rotate your wrists in a circular motion, making sure to move only your wrists and not your arms. Do 10 circles in each direction.
- Light weight curls: Grab a pair of light weights (or a weight bar) and do a few sets of 10-15 curls. This will help to warm up your biceps and forearms.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

1. Using a pronated grip, grasp the pull bar with a wider than shoulder width grip.
2. Take a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats.
3. Pull your chin towards the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.
4. Repeat for 3/4 sets of 4-8 reps.

## TIPS:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

- Try to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine.
- Avoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs.
- The pullup is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs. When this occurs, the elbows will flare up behind the body, the shoulder will round forward, and you’ll begin to feel pressure in the front of your shoulders.
- If you can’t complete a single bodyweight pullup, start with slow negatives (add weight when these can be accomplished under control) or flexed arm hangs in the top position.
